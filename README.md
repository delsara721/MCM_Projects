Programs that were used to find solutions to questions from Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM).  

Excerpts from the abstracts from MCM 2016, 2017 papers below. 

MCM 2016:
In our paper, we addressed the development of a model for determining an optimal investment strategy for the Goodgrant Foundation (made up foundation for the competition), who is awarding $100,000,000 a year to colleges and universities in the United States to improve the educational performance of undergraduates. The point-assignment model we develop assesses colleges and universities in the U.S. based on specific variables that will maximize the return of investment (ROI) for the Goodgrant Foundation. Our model assigns points to each college based on specific values for each of the variables, and these points are then used to prioritize the colleges we recommend to receive grants. The points are further weighted in our model to compute the recommended monetary grant value to be awarded to each college. Thus, the colleges are not chosen and given money at “random”, but evaluated for their excellence in the academia and their influence in the society at large. 

MCM 2017:
The research group investigates the problems of current airport security policies and procedures. A processor-based model is used to model teh passenger scanning process, identify bottlenecks , and examine teh effect potential modifications would have on passenger thrughput and wait time. Using an optimization model, the research group presents an optimalsecurity check configuration to minimize wait times.
